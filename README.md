# google-homepage

This is the first project I made using HTML and CSS. I learned how to move divs around, the types of positions for elements and how they get affected if another element comes into play. I used hovers to make buttons and links look a bit prettier, made a good looking search bar with a couple icons on it, and 2 navbars for the top and bottom parts of the webpage.

It was fun to do. I enjoyed it :)
